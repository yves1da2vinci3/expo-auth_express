React Native Expo Authentication Example
This is a simple React Native Expo project that demonstrates user authentication using a backend server built with Express. The authentication mechanism involves signup, login, and token refreshing. The backend is responsible for handling user registration, login, and providing a protected route that requires a valid access token.

Features
User registration (signup)
User login
Token refreshing
Protected route requiring a valid access token
Technologies Used
React Native Expo
Express (Node.js framework)
Expo SecureStore
AsyncStorage
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js and npm installed on your machine
Expo CLI installed (npm install -g expo-cli)
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/react-native-authentication.git
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd react-native-authentication
Install dependencies for the frontend:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Navigate to the backend directory:

Copy code
npm install
Running the App
Backend
Start the backend server:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The server will run on http://localhost:3000.

Frontend
Navigate back to the root project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd ..
Start the Expo development server:

bash
Copy code
expo start
This will open the Expo Developer Tools in your browser.

Use the Expo Client app on your mobile device or an emulator to scan the QR code and run the app.

Backend Endpoints
Signup:

Endpoint: POST /register
Example: http://localhost:3000/register
Login:

Endpoint: POST /login
Example: http://localhost:3000/login
Token Refresh:

Endpoint: POST /refresh-token
Example: http://localhost:3000/refresh-token
Protected Route:

Endpoint: GET /protected
Requires a valid access token.
Example: http://localhost:3000/protected
Usage
Open the app and navigate to the signup screen to create a new account.
After signup, login with your credentials.
Access the protected route, and it will display dummy data if your access token is valid.
The app uses Expo SecureStore and AsyncStorage to manage user tokens securely.
